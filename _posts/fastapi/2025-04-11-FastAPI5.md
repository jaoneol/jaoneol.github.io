## *What is Lifespan?*

In FastAPI, **lifespan** refers to the period covering the **startup** and **shutdown** phases of the application.

It allows you to:
- Run initialization tasks **when the app starts**.
- Perform cleanup tasks **when the app shuts down**.

In simple terms,  
**"lifespan" gives you a structured way to execute code at the very beginning and the very end of the app’s life cycle.**

## *Why Do We Need a Lifespan?*

Some typical use cases where lifespan is essential include:

- Initializing and closing database connections    
- Connecting and disconnecting from cache servers    
- Launching background tasks    
- Releasing resources like file handles or network sockets    
- Running health checks    

As systems grow more complex,  
**managing startup and shutdown tasks properly becomes critical** for stability and reliability.

## *How to Use Lifespan*

In FastAPI, you define lifespan logic using `@asynccontextmanager`.

Flow Summary:
- Server starts → execute code before `yield`.
- Server is running → handle HTTP requests.
- Server shuts down → execute code after `yield`.

```python
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    # Code to run at app startup
    print("The app has started!")
    
    yield  # FastAPI runs the application here
    
    # Code to run at app shutdown
    print("The app is shutting down!")

app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)
```

```bash

## *More Realistic Example*

Key Points:
- `asyncio.create_task()` is used to start an asynchronous background job.
- Upon shutdown, the task is **gracefully canceled** to prevent resource leaks.

```python
import asyncio
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format="[%(levelname)s] %(asctime)s %(message)s",
    handlers=[logging.StreamHandler()]
) 

async def periodic_task():
    while True:
        logging.info("Running periodic task...")
        await asyncio.sleep(5)  # Executes every 5 seconds  

@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    logging.info("Starting app initialization...")
    task = asyncio.create_task(periodic_task())  # Launch background task
    
    yield

    logging.info("Preparing for app shutdown...")
    task.cancel()  # Cancel background task

    try:
        await task
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        logging.info("Background task has been safely canceled.")

app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)
```
