FastAPI is a modern Python web framework that is optimized for high performance, especially in asynchronous environments. To fully utilize FastAPI's capabilities, it is important to understand the difference between **synchronous** and **asynchronous** programming.

In this post, we will explore how they differ, when to use each, and how they impact your FastAPI application’s performance.

The code below is used to print information about the response.(log_response_info)

```python
import aiohttp
from aiohttp import ClientResponseError
from pprint import pprint

async def log_response_info(response: aiohttp.ClientResponse):
    print("\n[Response Info]")
    # print(f"Status       : {response.status} {response.reason}")
    # print(f"URL          : {response.url}")
    # print(f"Method       : {response.method}")
    # print(f"Content-Type : {response.content_type}")
    # print(f"Charset      : {response.charset}")
    # print(f"Cookies      : {dict(response.cookies)}")
    # print(f"Headers:")
    # pprint(dict(response.headers))
    # print(f"OK?          : {response.ok}")

    try:
        data = await response.json()
        print(f"\nJSON Body:")
        print(f"type(data): {type(data)}")
        pprint(data)
    except aiohttp.ContentTypeError:
        text = await response.text()
        print(f"\nText Body:\n{text}")
```

## *What is Synchronous Programming?*

**Synchronous** (or "sync") programming is the traditional way of handling tasks. In synchronous code:
- A function call will **block** the execution until it completes.
- The CPU **waits** for the task to finish before moving on to the next one.

This can be inefficient if the task involves waiting, such as database queries or API requests.

#### *Example: Synchronous Route in FastAPI*

Here, the server **pauses** for 2 seconds and cannot process any other requests during that time.

```python
# routers/algo_sync.py

@router.get("/case1/")
def sync_func(
    question: Optional[str] = None, user_name: Optional[str] = None
):
    try:
        result = {
            "result": "ok",
            "question": question,
            "user_name": user_name,
            "message": "Synchronous processing completed"
        }
        time.sleep(2)
        return result
    except SQLAlchemyError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

```python
try:    
    url = "http://127.0.0.1:7249/ds2man/sync/case1"
    payload = {
        "question": "Where is the captial of Korea?",
        "user_name": "DS2Man"
    }

    start_time = time.time()
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession(
        trust_env=True, timeout=aiohttp.ClientTimeout(total=120)
    ) as session:
        async with session.get(url, params=payload) as response:
        # async with session.post(url, json=payload) as response:
            response.raise_for_status()
            await log_response_info(response)
    end_time = time.time()
    elapsed_time = end_time - start_time
    print(f"\nDuration: {elapsed_time:.2f}s")  
except ClientResponseError as e:
        print(f"[ClientResponseError] {e.status}: {e.message}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"[Unhandled Exception] {e}")
```

```bash
[Response Info]

JSON Body:
type(data): <class 'dict'>
{'message': 'Synchronous processing completed',
 'question': 'Where is the captial of Korea?',
 'result': 'ok',
 'user_name': 'DS2Man'}

Duration: 2.01s
```

## *What is Asynchronous Programming?*

**Asynchronous** (or "async") programming allows your application to handle other tasks while waiting for slow operations to complete:

- Functions declared with `async def` can **pause** at certain points using `await`, freeing the CPU to do other work.  
- Ideal for I/O-bound operations like database access, file reads, or calling external APIs.

#### *Example: Asynchronous Route in FastAPI*

Here, while waiting for 2 seconds, the server can continue handling other requests.

```python
# routers/algo_async.py

@router.get("/case1/")
async def async_func(
    question: Optional[str] = None, user_name: Optional[str] = None
):
    try:
        result = {
            "result": "ok",
            "question": question,
            "user_name": user_name,
            "message": "Asynchronous processing completed"
        }
        await asyncio.sleep(2)
        return result
    except SQLAlchemyError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

```python
try:    
    url = "http://127.0.0.1:7249/ds2man/async/case1"
    payload = {
        "question": "Where is the captial of Korea?",
        "user_name": "DS2Man"
    }

    start_time = time.time()
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession(
        trust_env=True, timeout=aiohttp.ClientTimeout(total=120)
    ) as session:
        async with session.get(url, params=payload) as response:
        # async with session.post(url, json=payload) as response:
            response.raise_for_status()
            await log_response_info(response)
    end_time = time.time()
    elapsed_time = end_time - start_time
    print(f"\nDuration: {elapsed_time:.2f}s")  
except ClientResponseError as e:
        print(f"[ClientResponseError] {e.status}: {e.message}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"[Unhandled Exception] {e}")
```

```bash
[Response Info]

JSON Body:
type(data): <class 'dict'>
{'message': 'Asynchronous processing completed',
 'question': 'Where is the captial of Korea?',
 'result': 'ok',
 'user_name': 'DS2Man'}

Duration: 2.03s
```

## *Key Differences Between Sync and Async*

|Aspect|Synchronous (`def`)|Asynchronous (`async def`)|
|---|---|---|
|CPU Utilization|Blocking (CPU waits)|Non-blocking (CPU can do other work)|
|Performance|Slower under high concurrency|Scales better with many concurrent requests|
|Best Use Cases|CPU-bound tasks|I/O-bound tasks (DB, network, files)|
|Keywords Used|`def`, `time.sleep()`|`async def`, `await`, `asyncio.sleep()`|

## *Using asyncio.gather*

We explored the concepts of synchronous and asynchronous processing. However, in the two examples above, both produced results after 2 seconds, making it difficult to feel the difference between them. To better understand the characteristics of asynchronous execution, I created an example using `asyncio.gather`.

`asyncio.gather()` is a built-in Python function that **runs multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently**. It starts all the tasks at once and waits until **all** of them complete.

Let's dive into how `asyncio.gather()` helps you run multiple async tasks at the same time and improve your application's performance.

```python
# routers/algo_async.py

async def fake_io(name: str, sec: int):
    start_time = time.time()
    await asyncio.sleep(sec)
    end_time = time.time()
    elapsed_time = end_time - start_time
    now = time.localtime()
    final_time = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", now)
    return f"{name}, Duration: {elapsed_time:.2f}s, FinalTime: {final_time}"

@router.get("/case2")
async def run_tasks(
    question: Optional[str] = None, user_name: Optional[str] = None
):
    tasks = []
    for idx in range(3):
        tasks.append(fake_io(user_name+chr(ord('A') + idx), idx+1))
        
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

    return {"results": results}
```

```python
import time

try:    
    url = "http://127.0.0.1:7249/ds2man/async/case2"
    payload = {
        "question": "Where is the captial of Korea?",
        "user_name": "DS2Man"
    }

    start_time = time.time()
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession(
        trust_env=True, timeout=aiohttp.ClientTimeout(total=120)
    ) as session:
        async with session.get(url, params=payload) as response:
        # async with session.post(url, json=payload) as response:
            response.raise_for_status()
            await log_response_info(response)
    end_time = time.time()
    elapsed_time = end_time - start_time
    print(f"\nDuration: {elapsed_time:.2f}s")  
except ClientResponseError as e:
        print(f"[ClientResponseError] {e.status}: {e.message}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"[Unhandled Exception] {e}")
```

```bash
[Response Info]

JSON Body:
type(data): <class 'dict'>
{'results': ['DS2ManA, Duration: 0.98s, FinalTime: 2025-05-11 09:48:13',
             'DS2ManB, Duration: 2.01s, FinalTime: 2025-05-11 09:48:14',
             'DS2ManC, Duration: 2.99s, FinalTime: 2025-05-11 09:48:15']}

Duration: 3.01s
```

As demonstrated in the example above, even though three `fake_io` tasks were executed, they ran simultaneously, and the results were returned in just 3 seconds instead of 6.

## *Conclusion*

Understanding the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming is essential to building efficient and scalable applications with FastAPI.  
By using `async def` and `await` properly, you can maximize the performance of your app, especially under heavy load with many concurrent users.

In summary:
- Use **synchronous** code for quick, CPU-bound tasks.
- Use **asynchronous** code for I/O-bound operations that involve waiting.

Understanding how to efficiently run multiple asynchronous tasks with `asyncio.gather()` is crucial for building high-performance Python applications. Whether you are making multiple database calls, external API requests, or any other I/O-heavy operations, `asyncio.gather()` helps you speed up the process by running them in parallel — **making your application faster and more scalable**.
