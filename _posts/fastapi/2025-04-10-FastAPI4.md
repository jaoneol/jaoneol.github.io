When building APIs with FastAPI, there are often cases where you want to handle certain tasks across **all requests or responses**.  
For example, you might want to log how long each request takes to process or add a common header to every response.  
This is where **middleware** comes in.

In this post, we’ll dive into what middleware is in FastAPI and how you can create your own.

## *What is Middleware?*

**Middleware** refers to code that runs **before the request reaches the route handler and before the response is sent back to the client**.

Middleware is ideal for handling operations such as:

- Logging every request    
- Authentication and authorization checks    
- Modifying request/response data    
- Setting CORS policies    
- Adding common response headers    
- Measuring request processing time    

In simple terms, middleware acts as a **layer between the client request and the route handler**, intercepting the flow.

## *Writing Middleware in FastAPI*

In FastAPI, the easiest way to create middleware is by using the `@app.middleware("http")` decorator.

Here’s the basic structure:

```python
# main.py

@app.middleware("http")
async def my_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
    # Code to run before the request is processed
    response = await call_next(request)
    # Code to run after the response is generated
    return response
```

- `request`: The incoming HTTP request object.
- `call_next`: A function that passes the request to the next stage (usually the route handler) and returns the response. 
- `response`: The final HTTP response after processing the request.

<!--
- `request`: 클라이언트로부터 받은 요청 객체입니다.    
- `call_next`: 다음 단계(보통 라우터 함수)로 요청을 넘기는 함수입니다.    
- `response`: `call_next`를 통해 받은 응답 객체입니다.
-->

Important Notes:
- Middleware runs for **every HTTP request**. If you want to apply it selectively, you’ll need to add extra logic inside the middleware.
- You **must call `call_next(request)`**; otherwise, the request won't proceed to the route handler.
- Avoid putting heavy or slow operations inside middleware, as it can **negatively impact** the overall API performance.


## *Use Cases for Middleware*

#### *Example1: User-Defined Request*

If you want to log information about every request, middleware makes it easy to implement.  
In this example, the `check_url_time` middleware logs the URL of each incoming request and the status code of the response.  
This allows you to easily monitor the behavior of your application.

```python
# main.py

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format="%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(message)s",
    handlers=[logging.StreamHandler()]
)

@app.middleware("http")
async def check_url_time(request: Request, call_next):
    start_time = time.time()
    logging.info(f"Request URL: {request.url.path}")
    response = await call_next(request)
    process_time = time.time() - start_time
    response.headers["Request-URL"] = str(request.url.path)
    response.headers["MyProcess-Time"] = str(process_time)
    logging.info(f"Response status code: {response.status_code}")
    
    return response
```

```python
import requests
from pprint import pprint 

url = "http://127.0.0.1:9248/ds2man/model1/async/batch/"
data = {
    "question": "Where is the captial of Korea?",
    "user_name": "DS2Man"
}

start_time = time.time()
response = requests.get(url, params=data)
end_time = time.time()
elapsed_time = end_time - start_time
print(f"Duration: {elapsed_time:.2f}s")

print(f"\nResponse:")
pprint(response.json())

print("\nResponse Headers:")
pprint(dict(response.headers))

print("\nRequest-URL:", response.headers.get("Request-URL"))
print("MyProcess-Time:", response.headers.get("MyProcess-Time"))
```

```bash
Duration: 3.02s

Response:
{'results': ['DS2ManA, Duration: 1.01s, FinalTime: 2025-04-28 14:20:19',
             'DS2ManB, Duration: 2.01s, FinalTime: 2025-04-28 14:20:20',
             'DS2ManC, Duration: 3.01s, FinalTime: 2025-04-28 14:20:21']}

Response Headers:
{'content-length': '190',
 'content-type': 'application/json',
 'date': 'Mon, 28 Apr 2025 05:20:18 GMT',
 'myprocess-time': '3.0119247436523438',
 'request-url': '/ds2man/model1/async/batch',
 'server': 'uvicorn'}

Request-URL: /ds2man/model1/async/batch
MyProcess-Time: 3.0119247436523438
```

#### *Example2: Adding CORS Header*

When developing APIs with FastAPI, handling **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** is essential.  Especially when the frontend (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte) and backend (FastAPI) are hosted on different domains, browsers may block requests due to CORS policies. To solve this, you need to add the appropriate **CORS headers** to your server responses.

In this post, we’ll walk through how to **manually add CORS headers using custom middleware** in FastAPI.

Setting up CORS in FastAPI is very simple. FastAPI provides `fastapi.middleware.cors.CORSMiddleware` for this purpose, and CORS issues can be resolved with just a few straightforward configurations.

In this example, CORS settings are configured using `CORSMiddleware`.
- **allow_origins**: Specifies the list of permitted origins. Only the domains listed here will be allowed to access the API.    
- **allow_credentials**: Determines whether requests that include credentials such as cookies should be permitted by the browser.    
- **allow_methods**: Defines the HTTP methods allowed for cross-origin requests. Setting it to `["*"]` permits all methods.    
- **allow_headers**: Defines the HTTP headers allowed for cross-origin requests. Setting it to `["*"]` permits all headers.

```python
# main.py

origins = [
    "http://ds2man.github.io",
    "https://ds2man.github.io",
    "http://localhost:9248"
]

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=origins,
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

For testing purposes or in a local development environment, there may be situations where requests from all origins need to be allowed. In such cases, `allow_origins` can be set to `["*"]`.

```python
# main.py

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"], 
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],  # ["GET", "POST"] ...
    allow_headers=["*"],  # ["Authorization"] ...
)
```

```python
import requests
from pprint import pprint 

url = "http://127.0.0.1:9248/ds2man/model1/async/batch/"
data = {
    "question": "Where is the captial of Korea?",
    "user_name": "DS2Man"
}

start_time = time.time()
response = requests.get(url, params=data)
end_time = time.time()
elapsed_time = end_time - start_time
print(f"Duration: {elapsed_time:.2f}s")

print(f"\nResponse:")
pprint(response.json())

print("\nResponse Headers:")
pprint(dict(response.headers))

print("\nRequest-URL:", response.headers.get("Request-URL"))
print("MyProcess-Time:", response.headers.get("MyProcess-Time"))
```

Please note that the output also includes the content from middleware example 1.

```bash
Duration: 3.02s

Response:
{'results': ['DS2ManA, Duration: 1.01s, FinalTime: 2025-04-28 14:20:19',
             'DS2ManB, Duration: 2.01s, FinalTime: 2025-04-28 14:20:20',
             'DS2ManC, Duration: 3.01s, FinalTime: 2025-04-28 14:20:21']}

Response Headers:
{'content-length': '190',
 'content-type': 'application/json',
 'date': 'Mon, 28 Apr 2025 05:20:18 GMT',
 'myprocess-time': '3.0119247436523438',
 'request-url': '/ds2man/model1/async/batch',
 'server': 'uvicorn'}

Request-URL: /ds2man/model1/async/batch
MyProcess-Time: 3.0119247436523438
```

#### *Example3: Class-Based Middleware*

In addition to functions, middleware can also be defined using classes.  
Class-based middleware is useful when maintaining state or performing initialization tasks is required.

The following example demonstrates a redirect and return process.  
For reference, this was slightly modified and tested based on the implementation used in OpenWebUI.

```python
# main.py

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next):
        if request.method == "GET":
            path = request.url.path
            query_params = dict(parse_qs(urlparse(str(request.url)).query))

            if path.endswith("/batch/class_based/") and "question" in query_params:
                question = query_params["question"][0]
                user_name = query_params.get("user_name", ["unknown"])[0]
                encoded_params = urlencode({"q": question, "user": user_name})
                redirect_url = f"/redirected_endpoint?{encoded_params}"
                return RedirectResponse(url=redirect_url)

        response = await call_next(request)
        return response
    
@app.get("/redirected_endpoint")
async def redirected_endpoint(q: str, user: str):
    start_time = time.time()

    response_data = {
        "message": "This request was redirected!",
        "question": q,
        "user_name": user,
    }

    response = JSONResponse(content=response_data)
    end_time = time.time()

    response.headers["Request-URL2"] = "/redirected_endpoint"
    response.headers["MyProcess-Time2"] = f"{(end_time - start_time):.2f}"

    return response

app.add_middleware(RedirectMiddleware)
```

```python
import requests
from pprint import pprint 

url = "http://127.0.0.1:9248/ds2man/model1/async/batch/class_based/"
data = {
    "question": "Where is the captial of Korea?",
    "user_name": "DS2Man"
}

start_time = time.time()
response = requests.get(url, params=data)
end_time = time.time()
elapsed_time = end_time - start_time
print(f"Duration: {elapsed_time:.2f}s")

print(f"\nResponse:")
pprint(response.json())

print("\nResponse Headers:")
pprint(dict(response.headers))

print("\nRequest-URL:", response.headers.get("Request-URL"))
print("MyProcess-Time:", response.headers.get("MyProcess-Time"))
```

```bash
Duration: 0.02s

Response:
{'message': 'This request was redirected!',
 'question': 'Where is the captial of Korea?',
 'user_name': 'DS2Man'}

Response Headers:
{'content-length': '107',
 'content-type': 'application/json',
 'date': 'Mon, 28 Apr 2025 07:21:01 GMT',
 'myprocess-time': '0.002000570297241211',
 'myprocess-time2': '0.00',
 'request-url': '/redirected_endpoint',
 'request-url2': '/redirected_endpoint',
 'server': 'uvicorn'}

Request-URL: /redirected_endpoint
MyProcess-Time: 0.002000570297241211
```


## *FastAPI Middleware Execution Order Rules*

#### *Execution Rules*

- Middleware added using `app.add_middleware()` (class-based middleware) is **executed in the order it was registered** when handling a request.
- Middleware defined using the `@app.middleware("http")` decorator (function-based middleware) is **executed after all class-based middleware**.
- During a **request**, middleware is executed **from top to bottom** (registration order).
- During a **response**, middleware is executed **in reverse order** (bottom to top).

#### *Example Structure*

```python
class RedirectMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next):
        print(">>> [Request] RedirectMiddleware")
        response = await call_next(request)
        print("<<< [Response] RedirectMiddleware")
        return response

@app.middleware("http")
async def check_url_time(request: Request, call_next):
    print(">>> [Request] check_url_time")
    response = await call_next(request)
    print("<<< [Response] check_url_time")
    return response

app.add_middleware(RedirectMiddleware)

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

#### *Request Flow (Incoming)*

1. `RedirectMiddleware` (class-based, added first)
2. `CORSMiddleware` (class-based, added second)
3. `check_url_time` (function-based, defined later)
4. Router handler (`@app.get`, `@app.post`, etc.)

#### *Response Flow (Outgoing)*

1. Router handler returns a response.    
2. `check_url_time` middleware processes the response.    
3. `CORSMiddleware` processes the response.    
4. `RedirectMiddleware` processes the response.
