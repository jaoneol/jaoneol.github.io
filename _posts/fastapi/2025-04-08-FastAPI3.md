When building larger FastAPI applications, organizing your code becomes crucial.  
Instead of putting all your endpoints into a single `main.py` file, FastAPI provides **APIRouter** to help you structure your project in a clean and modular way.

In this post, we’ll walk through a real-world example of how to use routers effectively, including how to configure your API metadata and documentation URLs.

## *Why Use Routers?*

Here’s why routers are essential in a real FastAPI project:
- **Separation of concerns**: Group related APIs together (e.g., model1 APIs, model2 APIs).
- **Easier maintenance**: Update or extend functionality without touching unrelated parts.
- **Better scalability**: As your API grows, routers make it easier to keep the project manageable.
- **Cleaner documentation**: Organized endpoints in your Swagger UI.

## *Example Project Structure*

Suppose we have a project that serves two sets of APIs, `model1` and `model2`.  
Here's the structure:

```bash
/project-root
    ├── main.py
    └── routers/
        ├── model1.py
        └── model2.py
```

- `main.py` is the main application entry point.
- `routers/model1.py` and `routers/model2.py` contain router definitions for different parts of the API.

#### *Main Application*

Let’s look at the full code:

```python
import uvicorn
from fastapi import FastAPI

from routers import (
    model1,
    model2
)

tags_metadata = [
    {"name": "Model1", "description": "Model1 API"},
    {"name": "Model2", "description": "Model2 API"}
]

app = FastAPI(
    title="Study API",
    summary="LLM Service API",
    version="1.0.0",
    contact={
        "name": "ds2man",
        "email": "jaoneol@gmail.com",
        "url": "ds2man.github.io"
    },
    openapi_tags=tags_metadata,
    docs_url='/ds2man/docs',
    redoc_url='/ds2man/redoc',
    openapi_url='/ds2man/openapi.json'
)

# Register routers
app.include_router(model1.router, prefix="/ds2man/model1", tags=['Model1'])
app.include_router(model2.router, prefix="/ds2man/model2", tags=['Model2'])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    access_port = 9248
    uvicorn.run("main:app", host="127.0.0.1", port=access_port, reload=True)
```

#### *Router Files*

Each router file looks like this:

Example: `routers/model1.py` and `routers/model2.py`

```python
# routers/model1.py

from fastapi import APIRouter

router = APIRouter()

@router.get("/info")
async def get_model1_info():
    return {"model": "Model1", "description": "This is model1 information."}
```

```python
# routers/model2.py

from fastapi import APIRouter

router = APIRouter()

@router.get("/info")
async def get_model2_info():
    return {"model": "Model2", "description": "This is model2 information."}
```

Each router defines its own routes, independent of the main application.

#### *Swagger UI*

## *Conclusion*

Using **FastAPI Routers** is a must if you want to build scalable and maintainable APIs.  
By cleanly separating different parts of your service into routers, you make it easier for both you and your team to manage growth and complexity.
