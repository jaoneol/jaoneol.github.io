When using Milvus through the Python client `pymilvus`, one of the most common operations you'll perform is a **vector similarity search**. After issuing a search query, the results are returned as `Hit` and `Hits` objects.

In this post, we'll clarify what `pymilvus.client.search_result.Hit` and `Hits` are, how to work with them, and what developers should keep in mind.

## *What Are Hit and Hits?*

In PyMilvus, when you perform a `search()` operation, the result is not just a plain list of dictionaries or raw data. Instead, PyMilvus wraps the results in structured classes to help you easily navigate the data.

## *Hit: A Single Search Result*

A `Hit` represents a **single matched entity** in the result of a vector search. It contains:
- `id`: The primary key (or vector ID) of the matched entity.
- `distance`: The similarity score between the query vector and this result.
- `entity`: The actual data (if youâ€™ve enabled output fields like `output_fields=["field_name"]` in your query).

```python
from pymilvus.client.search_result import Hit

print(f"ID: {hit.id}, Distance: {hit.distance}, Entity: {hit.entity}")
```
## *Hits: A Collection of Search Results*

A `Hits` object is a **list-like container** that holds all `Hit` objects corresponding to one query vector. If you search with multiple query vectors, the result will be a list of `Hits` - one for each query vector:

```python
results = collection.search(...)
# results: List[Hits]

for hits in results:  # Each `hits` corresponds to one query vector
    for hit in hits:  # Each `hit` is an individual Hit object
        print(hit.id, hit.distance)
```

## *Checking the type*

You may want to normalize the result shape:

```python
from pymilvus.client.search_result import Hit, Hits

if isinstance(result, Hit):
    result = [result]
elif isinstance(result, Hits):
    result = list(result)
```

This ensures `result` is always a list of `Hit` objects - which is easier to process consistently.

## *Example*

```python
PROCESSMAP_COSINE_REF = float(os.environ["MILVUS_RADIUS"])
LIMIT_CNT = 3
vector_res = client.search(
    collection_name=COLLECTION_NAME,
    data=vector_embedding, # Basic ANN Search
    output_fields=fields,
    limit=LIMIT_CNT,
)
result = vector_res[0] if vector_res[0] else []

from pymilvus.client.search_result import Hit, Hits
if isinstance(result, Hit):
    result = [result]
elif isinstance(result, Hits):
    result = list(result) 

rtn_msg = ""
for idx, item in enumerate(result):
    rtn_msg += textwrap.dedent(f"""

print(rtn_msg)
```
