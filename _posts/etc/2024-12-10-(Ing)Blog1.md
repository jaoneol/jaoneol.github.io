I recently launched my blog and became curious about the number of visitors and where they were coming from. So I decided to connect Google Analytics 4 (GA4). The setup was quite simple.

## *What is GA4?*

**Google Analytics 4 (GA4)** is the latest version of Google Analytics, offering more flexible and event-based tracking compared to the previous Universal Analytics. GA4 is now the default for all new properties and supports both websites and apps.

## *Create GA4 to a Jekyll Blog*

- Log in to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/). 
- Click the ⚙️ **Admin** icon at the bottom-left corner → Select **Create Account** or choose an existing one.
- If creating a new account, click **Create Account** → Enter your blog name → Set your time zone and currency.
   If using an existing account, click **Create Property** under that account instead.
- When prompted to choose a platform, select **Web**.
- In the "Set up a data stream" popup, enter your blog's URL.    
- Once the web stream is created, go to **Google Tag Instructions** → Copy the provided code → Paste it into your blog’s code, typically in the `_includes/head.html` file.
