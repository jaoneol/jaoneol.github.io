## *A Fulfilling First Quarter of 2025*

The first quarter flew by like a whirlwind. At the end of last year, I set new goals for myself, wondering, _"Can I really follow through on all of this?"_ But to cut to the chase, I’d say I’m **120% satisfied**. It was the first time I’ve taken on a challenge like this in my life, and above all, I’m proud of myself for doing so. I'm deeply grateful to myself for pushing through, and I especially want to thank my wife, who quietly stood by my side throughout.

#### *Starting a Blog*

To be honest, the idea of starting a blog has been on my mind for the past three years. But I kept finding excuses to put it off and never actually got started until this year. I finally took that first step. Once again, I was reminded that **clear motivation is the most powerful force that drives our lives forward**.

I built the blog using GitHub Pages, and from installing Ruby and Jekyll to setting up the environment and generating the blog itself, I went through quite a few bumps along the way. It was hard to find straightforward solutions, even through Googling or ChatGPT. I had to figure things out myself. Surprisingly, I actually enjoyed that process. Looking back, those experiences have become personal assets I truly value.

As of April 5, 2025, I’ve written **52 posts in just three months**. I only slept around 4 hours a day, but I genuinely enjoyed breaking down what I know and what I don’t. I still have a lot to learn, but I believe I’ve **laid a solid foundation to increase my own value**.

Planting green grass on GitHub… well, that was just a fun bonus. 😅

#### *LLM & RAG*

As I’ve mentioned in previous posts, I believe my future lies in **LLM and RAG**. That’s why I’ve been dedicating myself to studying this field lately. The rapid, almost intimidating pace of AI development can feel overwhelming at times, but as long as I stay focused like I am now, I believe I’ll be able to keep up by the next quarter.

One thing that especially blew my mind recently was **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**. It felt like witnessing another paradigm shift. In this rapidly changing landscape, I’m reminded how important it is to **stay a lifelong learner**.

Thankfully, a department showed interest in the LLM-related POC I led last year, and I was lucky enough to be asked to lead the development directly. I still have much to learn, but the **confidence** that I can do this comes from the steady effort I’ve put in so far. That’s why I plan to dive even deeper into this area in the second quarter.

#### *No more part leader roles*

It was a bit of a bittersweet decision, but ultimately a good one. While it was a chance to demonstrate leadership, the managerial role at Samsung didn’t quite align with the ideal I had in mind. So I stepped down.

This decision freed up my time and allowed me to **focus on the path I truly want to take**, which made it a very meaningful change.

#### *In Closing*

2025 started off on fire. As I steadily pursued the goals I had set, I learned, grew, and reaffirmed my direction. I still have areas to improve, but I believe the experiences and insights I gained will be a great source of strength moving forward.

I hope this blog becomes more than just a journal. I want it to be a space where I can have honest conversations with myself—and perhaps, offer a bit of inspiration to someone else. Just as I’ve been doing, I want to keep learning, practicing, sharing, and growing.

Here’s to continuing this passion and focus in the next quarter. And to you, reading this—I genuinely wish you the best as you run your own race with pride and joy.
