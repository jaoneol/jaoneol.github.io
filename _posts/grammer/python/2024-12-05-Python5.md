When developing code in Jupyter Notebook, it's very inconvenient to restart the kernel every time you modify an external `.py` file. In this post, we'll learn how to check the updated results immediately without restarting the kernel, even after modifying the module.

## *Usage*

Enter the following in a cell at the top of your Jupyter Notebook:

```python
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
```

#### *Example*

  For example, let's assume there is an external file named `sample.py`.

```python
# sample.py

def hello():
    return "Hello World!"
```

Usage in the notebook:

```python
from sample import hello

hello() # "Hello World!"
```

If you later modify `sample.py` as shown below:

```python
# sample.py

def hello():
    return "Hello DS2Man!"
```

If you run the code below, the result from before the modification will appear.

```python
from sample import hello

hello() # "Hello World!"
```

Even without restarting the kernel, if `%autoreload 2` is set, you can immediately see the updated results when you run the next cell.

```python
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
from sample import hello

hello() # "Hello DS2Man!"
```
