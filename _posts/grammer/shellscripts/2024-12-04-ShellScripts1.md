## *Shebang*

The first line written in a script defines which shell will be used to execute the script when it runs.  
There are multiple versions of shells.    
- sh: The original Unix shell (Bourne shell), released in 1977.    
- ksh: Also known as the Korn shell, developed by David Korn in 1983 as an extension of `sh`.
- csh: Created in 1978 at the University of California, Berkeley, based on the C programming language.    
- <ins>**bash**: Developed by Brian Fox in 1987, it is mostly compatible with `sh`.</ins>

The first line is a declaration that the script will be executed using the standard shell, `bash`.  
This type of shell declaration is called a **Shebang**.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash
echo $(which bash) # /usr/bin/bash
```

```bash
/usr/bin/bash
```

## *File Permission Settings and Execution*


```bash
# Case1)
$ vi mytest.sh
# #!/usr/bin/bash
# echo $(which bash)
$ chmod +x mytest.sh or chmod 755 mytest.sh
$ ./mytest.sh

# Case2)
$ vi mytest.sh
# #!/usr/bin/bash
# echo $(which bash)
$ bash mytest.sh # When executed with `bash`, it can run without granting execute permissions.
```

```bash
$ /usr/bin/bash
```

## *Shell Variable Declaration*

### *basic*

There are various types of variables, such as local variables, global variables, environment variables, reserved variables, and parameters.

- Variables are case-sensitive.    
- Variable names can include numbers, but cannot start with a number.    
- All values are stored as **strings** in variables.    
- Data types are not specified when declaring variables (e.g., `int number`, `char names[10]` are not used), meaning you can assign any value.    
- When using a variable, prefix its name with the special character `$` (e.g., `echo ${myname} or echo $myname`).    
- When assigning a value to a variable, do **not** use `$` (e.g., `myname=ds2man`).    
- There should be no spaces around the `=` sign when creating a variable (e.g., `myname="abcd"`).

```bash
## $ vi mytest.sh

#!/usr/bin/bash

myname="ds2man"
phone_no1=01011233342 # type is string!
phone_no2="01011233342" # type is string!

echo $myname
echo "my name is ${myname}"
echo my name is ${myname}
printf "%d vs %s\n" $phone_no1 $phone_no1 # not %d, %s is collect
printf "%d vs %s\n" $phone_no2 $phone_no2 # not %d, %s is collect
printf "=========\n"
unset myname # initialize variable
echo my name is ${myname}
```

```bash
$ ./mytest.sh
ds2man
my name is ds2man
my name is ds2man
136656610 vs 01011233342
136656610 vs 01011233342
=========
my name is
```

### *Environment Variable*

In a shell script, prefixing a variable name with `export` sets it as an environment variable, making it accessible in child scripts.  
However, when using environment variables, be careful not to use variable names that conflict with predefined **reserved variables** in the system.

```bash
## $ vi mytest.sh

#!/usr/bin/bash

echo ${myname}
```

```bash
$ export myname="ds2man is datascientist"
$ ./mytest.sh
ds2man is datascientist
```

### *Global and Local Variable*

Variables declared in the shell are, by default, **global variables**.  However, <ins>local variables can be used only within functions</ins>, and to declare them, you need to prefix the variable name with `local`.

```bash
## $ vi mytest.sh

#!/usr/bin/bash

mystring="ds2man study" # global variable

function string_test() {
    # A variable is recognized as a local variable only when prefixed with `local`.  
    # If `local` is omitted, it will overwrite the global variable instead.
    local mystring="ds2man lecture"
    echo string_test, ${mystring}
}


string_test # string_test() is error...
echo out of string_test, ${mystring}

# 변수 초기화
unset string
```

```bash
$ ./mytest.sh
string_test, ds2man lecture
out of string_test, ds2man study
```

## *Control Structures*

Shell scripting allows us to control the flow of execution using conditional and loop statements, just like in most programming languages. we’ll go over five key control structures: **`if`**, **`case`**, **`for`**, **`for-in`**, and **`while`**, with clear examples for each.

### *if Statement*

Before diving into the `if` statement, let's take a look at comparison operators and logical operators

```bash
# comparison operators
value1 -eq value2     # equal, Note. not ==
value1 -ne value2     # not equal, Note. not !=
value1 -lt value2     # less than, Note. not <
value1 -le value2     # less than or equal, Note. not <=
value1 -gt value2     # greater than. not >
value1 -ge value2     # greater than or equal, Note. not >=

string1 = string2        # string1 and string2 are equal (just one '=' works like in SQL)
string1 == string2       # string1 and string2 are equal
string1 != string2       # string1 and string2 are not equal
-z string                # true if the string is null (zero length)
-n string                # true if the string is not null
string == pattern        # true if the string matches the pattern
string != pattern        # true if the string does not match the pattern

# logical operators
condition1 && condition2     # AND
condition1 || condition2     # OR
!condition                   # condition is not true  
true                         # always true  
false                        # always false  

```

Note. **Double Parentheses (( expression ))**    
An arithmetic or comparison expression can be placed inside the `expression`.

```bash
## $ vi mytest.sh

#!/usr/bin/bash

# The `read` command is used to receive input from the user and store it in a variable.
read -p "Enter a number: " num1 num2

if [ ${num1} -lt ${num2} ]; then 
	echo "${num1} is less then ${num2}"
elif [ ${num1} -gt ${num2} ]; then 
	echo "${num1} is greater then ${num2}"
else
	echo "${num1} is equal to ${num2}"
fi

echo "Double Parentheses"
if (( ${num1} < ${num2} )); then 
	echo "${num1} < ${num2}"
elif (( ${num1} > ${num2} )); then 
	echo "${num1} > ${num2}"
else
	echo "${num1} is equal to ${num2}"
fi
```

```bash
$ ./mytest.sh
Enter a number: 3 5
3 is less then 5
Double Parentheses
3 < 5
```

## *case Statement*

```bash
## $ vi mytest.sh

#!/bin/bash

read -p "Choose an option (a/b/c): " option

case $option in
  a)
    echo "You selected option A."
    ;;
  b)
    echo "You selected option B."
    ;;
  c)
    echo "You selected option C."
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Invalid input."
    ;;
esac
```

```bash
$ ./mytest.sh
Choose an option (a/b/c): c
You selected option C.
```

## *for Loop Statement*

```bash
## $ vi mytest.sh

#!/usr/bin/bash

for ((i=1; i<=5; i++))
do
  echo "Current number: $i"
done
```

```bash
$ ./mytest.sh
Current number: 1
Current number: 2
Current number: 3
Current number: 4
Current number: 5
```

## *for-in Loop Statement*

```bash
## $ vi mytest.sh

#!/usr/bin/bash

FRULTS=("apple" "banana" orange)
# Note. `[@]` splits each element of the array into separate individual arguments.
for fruit in "${FRULTS[@]}" # for fruit in ${FRULTS[@]} is same!
do
  echo "Fruit: $fruit"
done
```

```bash
$ ./mytest.sh
Fruit: apple
Fruit: banana
Fruit: orange
```

## *while Loop Statement*

```bash
## $ vi mytest.sh

#!/usr/bin/bash

count=1

while (( $count <= 5 ))
do
  echo "Count: $count"
  ((count++))
done
```

```bash
$ ./mytest.sh
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Count: 5
```
